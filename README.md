## Server Libraries & Dependencies:

- `express ^4.17.1` - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. The server for this application has been built with the Express framework to allow for secure, simple routing, middleware support and a modular application.
- `mongoose ^5.9.22` - Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It allows the creation of strongly-typed schemas for MongoDB documents to provide data validation. Several models have been defined within the server containing Mongoose schemas to better structure and validate database documents.
- `mongoose-Seed ^0.6.0` - Mongoose-seed lets you populate and clear MongoDB documents with all the benefits of Mongoose validation. We have decided to include this package to allow users running the site locally to have dummy data to experiment with app functionality with ease.
- `mongoose-unique-validator` - A plugin which adds pre-save validation for unique fields within a Mongoose schema. This is used to add an extra layer of validation when new users create accounts.
- `express-session ^1.17.1` - Creates user sessions and stores the session data on the server and gives the client a session ID to access the data. Express-session is also used to configure cookies to send between the client and server.
- `connect-mongo ^3.2.0` - Allows for user sessions created with express-session to be saved in the Mongo database. It automatically removes expired sessions based on the lifespan of the session set in app.js.
- `cors ^2.8.5` - CORS is a node.js package for middleware that enables cross origin resource sharing between the Express server and React client.
- `passport, passport-local and passport-local-mongoose` - Passport is authentication middleware for Node. js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. We have decided to use Passport as it is a more secure way of authenticating users compared to building our own auth system.
- `dotenv ^8.2.0` - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Env variables have been used to safely store information such as database keys and to conditionally determine which version of the client to connect with.
- `body-parser ^1.19.0` - Body parser extracts the entire body of an incoming request and exposes it on req.body. The body of incoming request objects contains information from the client to access the database and is used in the server for authentication.

#### Server Development dependencies

- `mocha ^8.0.1` - Testing framework used to unit test the different api endpoints within the server.
- `expect ^26.1.0` - Expect is a library for assertion in tests and is used as a dependency of mocha.
- `nodemon ^2.0.4` - Nodemon is used to automatically restart the node server when changes have been detected. The `npm start` script has been modified to execute nodemon in development to use this feature.
- `prettier ^2.0.5` - Used to declare a pre-defined code format to maintain consistency across different developer machines.

### Client Libraries & Dependencies:

- `react ^16.13.1`: A Javascript Front-end library for building user interfaces and maintained by Facebook. The client side of this application is built with the react library alongside notable third party complimentary react libraries.
- `react-dom ^16.13.1` - React dom is a complimentary library to react which binds react to the DOM. This enables us to use methods such as `render()` to render components in the browser.
- `react-router-dom ^5.2.0` - Allows for conditional rendering of components in a single page application based on the route being used in the URL. This allows us to build a SPA that acts like a site with multiple pages.
- `react-scripts 3.4.1` - The react scripts enables additional scripts on top of those configured by create-react-app. This has been used to create a custom build script for our staging environment of the application.
- `react-simple-maps ^2.1.2` - Used to create the interactive map of bookings by country in the user dashboard.
- `react-tooltip ^4.2.7` - Used as a dependency to react-simple-maps, this package is used to create tooltips that appear over countries when they are hovered over on the interactive map.
- `material UI core, lab & icons` - Material UI is a React design component library that utilises Material Design principles.
- `axios ^0.19.2` - Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests to the server from the client. Axios configuration has been set in src/config/api.js to use environment variables via `process.env`. Bookings, auth and fairy services each use axios to make HTTP requests to their dedicated api end points on the server.
- `chart.js ^2.9.3` - A JavaScript library that provides simple and flexible charting. Chart.js was used to create the animated doughnut diagram displaying bookings by continent on the admin dashboard.
- `env-cmd ^10.1.0` - A node program to execute commands given in an env file. This has been used alongside react-scripts to use environment variables when using the custom build script for staging.
- `moment ^2.27.0` - A library to format dates used within the application into a human readable format.

#### Client Development dependencies

- `cypress ^4.10.0` - Cypress is an end to end testing framework for anything that runs in the browser. Cypress has been used in the application to unit test client-side components and integration test between the front and back end.
- `eslint-plugin-cypress ^2.11.1` - An additional linter specifically for Cypress testing. Without this linter, VS Code does not recognise some of the Cypress functions as declared.
- `prettier ^2.0.5` - Used to declare a pre-defined code format to maintain consistency across different developer machines.

## Project management

In phase one of this project we undertook extensive market research and planning from briefs given to us by the client. We finished what would be the first sprint with the green-light to run with the project. A sprint review at the end of sprint one had most of the documentation completed

We had done our preliminary sprint planning where we had added the most obvious tasks to the Trello, but at our agile ceremony we got out the user stories to effectively project manage. As we read through each user story we discussed which tasks the story gave us. When we reached a consensus we would add the cards to the Trello. We also discussed which tasks were the most important to complete first and started planning our sprints accordingly. We are a very effective agile team and agreed immediately on an effort estimation of getting as much done in the first two sprints as we could as our experience suggested the client would add new features as the project progressed.

This was the longest ceremony and it helped us build a plan, using the Trello board, with a comprehensive lists of tasks. The tasks were all given a due-date based on which sprint they were in, and a rating of easy, medium and hard. Tasks for the first sprint were given an agile estimate and then were allocated fairly. We were going to use planning poker, but it was quite hard in a team of two and we were pretty much in agreement about how long each task would take.

We decided on 5 day sprints and started each day at 9am with a stand-up on Discord. At the stand-up we discussed how we went the day previously and talked through any blockers. We planned more difficult tasks to fall on the days that we could pair-programme. At the end of each sprint we checked that we had completed all the tasks assigned on the Trello for the sprint and marked them as done or pushed them into sprint backlog. This really only happened between Sprint 4 and 5 when the FIC(Fairy in Charge) added new features and they were more complex than expected.

As previously stated, all tasks were colour coded for difficulty - green tag for easy, blue tag for medium, red tag for hard. Most jobs fell into the medium category but we tried to equally share the hard jobs or pair-programmed them. We really wanted to solidify our skills, so neither of us were trying to avoid the tough jobs! We split the server and React set-up into front and back-end to quickly get to a point of deploying and connecting the two. Therefore for the first sprint Louise was mostly only working in the server and Catherine was working in React. However, as soon as we had deployed we took on tasks in both back and front-end.

#### Sprint 1

We worked extra hard in the first two sprints and set up Front and Backend Frameworks with CRUD functionality and Mongo. All functions were manually tested until they were operating as expected. During this time we had some issues with finding our 'Git Flow', but by the end of sprint 1 we were confidently using forking flow. No other blockers during this sprint.

##### User Stories addressed

3. As the parent in a chaotic family, we have been known to lose the occasional tooth before the tooth fairy can collect it. In these cases it is reassuring to know that I can login to my personal portal and cancel a tooth collection.

4. As a parent of twins my boys do everything together, sometimes even lose teeth. I need to be able to update my pick-up order from one to two or more teeth.

### Sprint 2

Sprint 2 was all about Login Functionality (authorisation) on both the front and back end and deployment. We believe in deploying early and often. We set up a CI/CD pipeline so that each time we did a Pull Request in Github our site was deployed in a development environment. At the end of each sprint we merged our development branch to master which deployed to our production branch. This was tricky, but very worthwhile as we always know our production code is working even if we temporarily break our development app. We also ran working Mocha and unit tests on the booking component and started Cypress testing. Cypress testing slowed us down somewhat because we didn't have any experience, but we got there in the end and now find it so useful.

We also addressed the FIC's concerns about site security. She keeps a lot of sensitive data and was worried about being hacked, so we outsourced the site security to Santa's elves who are 'red hat' hackers.

##### User Stories addressed

1. As a busy parent I need to organise a Tooth Fairy pick up quickly and easily. Being able to login to a portal where all my details are saved saves me a lot of time.

2. As the Fairy In Charge, the most important thing for me is that my online portal is secure to protect the Top Secret Secret about what I do with all of the teeth.

#### Sprint 3

We started adding some basic Material-ui components to design the front-end of the app. Built the framework for a dashboard for the FIC. After UI testing we decided to improve the booking form by adding a currency and continent drop down, and redesigned it. Created a 'success' capability so that parents can easily see if their booking has been accepted. Started working on our very important side-nav component, added Fairy \$ exchange and added more Cypress tests. Finally we bought a custom domain and deployed to it. Catherine had some trouble setting up pagination in the server but as the team are using Material-ui they found an easier way of using it for pagination in React.

##### User Stories addressed

2. As a parent of an anxious child I need the peace of mind that when I book the Tooth Fairy there will definitely be a pick-up that same night. My child would be so disappointed to find the tooth still under her pillow in the morning, so I need to receive confirmation that my booking has been successful.

3. As the Fairy in Charge (FIC) of Tooth Inc, an online dashboard is imperative to the successful running of one of the biggest organizations in Fairyland.

4. As the Fairy In Charge at Tooth Inc, fiscal responsibility is a huge part of my job. Having a place where I can see with a glance how the organisation is positioned makes it easier for me to focus on what is really important.

Second Consult 2. As the FIC I operate in all the major currencies and need my dashboard to give me the daily Fairy \$ exchange rate which is based on an amalgamation of the biggest currencies.

#### Sprint 4

After another consultation, including user testing, with the FIC, she has decided that she wants to view each Continent Manager in a Fairy profile. This will render the managers' rating; work ID photo; short bio and all their bookings. We made her Fairyness understand that at this late stage of the project resources would have to be pulled from elsewhere, so she decided that she could live without email confirmation and we added this new component to sprint 4. She also mentioned that she was becoming overwhelmed with the number of wishes she received so we agreed to build a wish component into the app. This turned out harder than expected and caused a short blocker. We also finished the rating component which had been planned for this sprint.

##### User Stories addressed

5. As a parent that wants only the best for my child I need to be able to rate and review the service I have received from the Tooth Fairy.

6. As the Fairy In Charge I am personally responsible for collecting and 'taking care of' the lost baby teeth of every single child on Earth and I need a responsive environment to manage all of the bookings.

7. As the Fairy In Charge I need all of the daily tooth pick-ups to be automatically collated into an order summary report for the manager of each continent.

8. As the Fairy in Charge I need to easily see how each continents' manager is rating so I can quickly take steps to maintain my good reputation.

Second Consult - 3. As the FIC I am a very visual person so I would like charts on my dashboard so I can easily understand the displayed data.

Third Consult - 1 As the FIC I would like to see each continent manager, remember who they are (I am 3562 years old!) and see their bookings and ratings.

Third Consult - 2 As the FIC I would love to receive wishes one by one with a button I can click to grant them or not (and not have to explain my reasoning!)

#### Sprint 5

At our Sprint 4 review we discussed our sprint backlog because we hadn't finished the wish and continent components. We agreed to do some pair programming to push these tasks out quickly and then focused on some 'sprinkle' design elements.

##### User Stories addressed

Still working on third consult user stories from Sprint 4.

#### Final Sprint

By the final sprint most coding was complete so we had 4 days to refactor code to make it drier, add some design sprinkles and work on docs. Two of the sprinkles were a Captcha to check if the person logging on is actually an adult, and an image on the login page.

On the day before handover we discovered a bug. Google Chrome had a major update that caused a problem with our cookies which meant that our production site was not receiving any data from the server that depended on the user being logged in. This is basically our entire site. Our plans to finish the code were put on hold while we spent hours fixing it. We finally found a solution to the bug and were very grateful that we had built extra time into the project to address unexpected issues.

##### User Stories addressed

Checked that all user stories were addressed.

The-Tooth-Business/client pull requests #63-80
The-Tooth-Business/server pull request #33-35 all other pull requests were attempting to fix bug.

### Retrospective

Louise and Catherine are so proud of this project. They have not only worked very hard to get it done to the quality they expect of themselves, but they made the FIC happy. They have at at all times worked as a team and pulled the other through on the odd occasion that things got tough. Even when the bug almost destroyed their project the day before handover they were laughing through the debugging session. The only thing they are disappointed about not getting done is the email functionality, but it was a decision of the client to let it go in favour of some other components that the team is very happy with.

The Tooth Fairy was so satisfied with the final product that she is already discussing possible future projects - such as a blog for entrepreneurs and a dropshipping site.
